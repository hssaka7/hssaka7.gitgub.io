Greetings! I'm Aakash Basnet, a Software Engineer with 6 years of hands-on experience. 

My journey involves working closely with clients as a consultant, where I've tackled various projects, from crafting web applications and dashboards to implementing machine learning solutions and web scraping tools. I take pride in simplifying complex tech challenges and creating solutions that align with clients' unique needs. 

Beyond coding, I find joy in hiking, mountain biking, boxing and reading, maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Let's connect and explore how we can create something exceptional together!
